	<blurb> Director and artist Marco Brambilla meets Kayne West in this serie of epic pictures and video// POWER shows a continuous camera move from extreme close-up of Mr. West revealing an a neoclassical video tableau showing characters and creatures surrounding him in an abstract environment – all moving in extreme slow motion. Inspired by Michelangelo’s frescos in the Sistine Chapel, the piece depicts a faux historical moment – an empire on the brink of collapse from its own excess, decadence and corruption. // Brambilla lives and works in New York and has received awards from the Tiffany Comfort Foundation and the Colbert Foundation for his work in film and video. Brambilla has been honored with solo exhibitions including a 10-year survey, The Dark Lining, at Santa Monica Museum of Art, Santa Monica, CA (2011); Contemporary Arts Forum, Santa Barbara, CA (2004); and New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York (2003). His works have been screened at the Venice Biennale (2011) and the Sundance Film Festival, Park City, UT (2012 and 2006). Brambilla’s work is in the collections of such institutions as Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, NY; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, NY; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, CA; and Corcoran Museum, Washington DC, among others. </blurb>
